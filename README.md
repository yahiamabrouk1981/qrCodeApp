# QR Code Link Sharing Application

This project allows users to generate QR codes for URLs and images. It includes both frontend and backend components:

- **Frontend**: Built with React, the frontend enables users to input URLs or upload images. It generates QR codes that can be scanned to view the content directly on mobile devices.

- **Backend**: Developed with Node.js and Express, the backend handles image uploads, URL-to-QR code conversion, and serves static files. It generates QR codes based on provided URLs or image data.

## Features

- Upload images and generate QR codes that display the uploaded image when scanned.
- Generate QR codes for URLs that direct to the specified link when scanned.
- User-friendly interface for both image upload and URL input.
